Publication on the web of multimedia gallery is now as easy as just dropping file in winscp :) 

Bored of geeks, welcome back to plain old apache core features, no DB, no PHP, no framework needed for this to work. 
You just needed apache >= 1.0


Transforming apache default mode for directory into a client side web gallery for multimedia types 

It relies heavily on modern browser capacity : 
* <audio>, <video>, <embed> HTML5 new tags ; 
* css3 rotation 
* jquery

Added a fb share for each media so that you wont have to administrate comment

Can support more than one theme 

Customisable with the sneaky use of <input type=hidden > tags

Can load a desc.html (where you put your custom values also) in order to have a per directory

A fortune as usual cause I luv fortunes
